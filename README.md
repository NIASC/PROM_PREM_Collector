# PROM_PREM_Collector
This is an application designed to collect PROM (patient reported outcome measures) and PREM (patient reported experience measures).

The [wiki page](https://github.com/marmalmstudent/PROM_PREM_Collector/wiki) has not yet been updated for this branch, so you should not rely on the information about extending the program there being accurate. You can still use it to find information about how to run the software.
